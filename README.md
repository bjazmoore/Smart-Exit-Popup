## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I customize the look and feel of the popup?

Yes! The Smart Exit Popup admin panel supports extensive customization including a formatted Header bar, Footer bar, configurable image overlay, and multiple color options. Extend the design using formatting tools in the popup message editor.

### Can I use advanced HTML or inline SVG?

Yes! Enable **Power User Mode** to safely use inline SVG, `<style>` blocks, and advanced layouts (like flexbox or grid) in your popup content. *Note:* Switching back to Visual mode may strip these advanced tags.

### Why does Visual mode strip advanced HTML?

This is a built-in WordPress behavior. The visual editor sanitizes content to prevent unsafe HTML, which can remove tags like `<svg>` or `<style>`. Power User Mode bypasses this — but switching back re-triggers the sanitization.

### Can I add social sharing buttons?

Absolutely. Use **Power User Mode** and paste your custom markup. Inline SVG icons are supported.

### Does it work on mobile devices?

Exit intent detection is **disabled on mobile/touch devices** to avoid false triggers from swipes or scrolls.

### Will this slow down my site?

Nope! It’s ultra-lightweight — one stylesheet and one JavaScript file on the frontend, and no external dependencies.

### Can users prevent the popup from appearing again?

Yes. Enable the “Don’t show again” checkbox — the user’s choice is remembered using `localStorage`.
